Feature: Packaging
	In order to avoid deployment issues
	As a software packager
	I want to be sure that opencover runs after installation

@ziptag
Scenario: Run OpenCover after installing from zip file
	Given I have a valid zip package in the output folder
	And I unzip that package into a deployment folder
	When I execute the deployed OpenCover against the x86 target application
	And I execute the deployed OpenCover against the x64 target application
	Then the coverage results should be the same

@nugettag
Scenario: Run OpenCover after installing from a nuget package
	Given I have a valid nugetpackage in the output folder
	And I unpack that package into a deployment folder
	When I execute the deployed OpenCover against the x86 target application in subfolder tools
	And I execute the deployed OpenCover against the x64 target application in subfolder tools
	Then the coverage results should be the same
