## How to contribute

OpenCover is open to all and we encourage the community to contribute in the project. However, it is very important to follow couple of simple rules when you create an issue report or send a pull request.

### Submitting issues and features

OpenCover isn't perfect and it will have issues we do our best to stay on top of them but we occasionaly take a break from development to do other things. 

If you are raising an issue please check that you are using the latest version from either our [releases](https://github.com/OpenCover/opencover/releases) or [nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenCover/). If the issue persists then please try to supply as much detail as you can and if possible supply a sample that we can use to repeat the issue described.  

If you are requesting a feature, please supply why it is useful and what the benefits are. OpenCover was developed to meet a need to have a code coverage tool and so if we haven't yet implemented something we need to be sold on the idea.

If your issue/feature is urgent consider fixing/implementing it yourself. 

### Submitting pull requests

We welcome contributions but we do require that you do the following

1. Follow the coding style, we pretty well follow the standard Visual Studio C# style with a hint of Resharper.
2. Supply unit tests to accompany your submission.
3. Make sure you build and run all the tests locally.
4. Sign the [Contibuting Licence Agreement](https://cla-assistant.io/OpenCover/opencover) - this will happen when you submit a pull request so you don't need to sign the CLA until then.
5. Monitor the [build](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/sawilde/opencover), we use AppVeyor CI to build and test the code as part of the review process.
