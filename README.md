### Issues
Please raise issues on GitHub, if you can repeat the issue then please provide a sample to make it easier for us to also repeat it and then implement a fix. Please do not hijack unrelated issues, I would rather you create a new issue than add noise to an unrelated issue.

Dropbox is very useful for sharing files [Dropbox] (http://db.tt/VanqFDn)

### Project Management
Currently using AgileZen to organise the project and workflow, however you may have to become a member and/or get an invite. Initially I'll grant view only access to those who are just interested i.e. "Chickens" and grant greater rights to those people who wish to, or already actively, contribute i.e. "Pigs".

### Thanks
I would like to thank the guys at CodeBetter, Devlicious and Los Techies who arranged my MSDN licence and also to the NextGenUG and their free swag from where I got lots of useful tools. I'd also like to thank my employers, colleagues and friends for all their support.
